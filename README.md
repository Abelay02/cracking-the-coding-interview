# Cracking the Coding Interview in Python

This repo will follow my journey through "Cracking the Coding Interview". I'm using Jupyter notebooks to solve problems and jot down notes. Also using this as a convenient way to get in the habit of contributing to my Github.

## What's Inside

- Each notebook will be a solution to a problem in the book, or a data structure that I'm building from scratch.
